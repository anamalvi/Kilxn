# Kilxn
Chrome extension for saving and indexing image URLs, unpacked, soon to hit the net (like a bad serve).

To install, open Chrome -> Go to chrome://extensions -> Load unpacked extension -> Select Kilxn directory

Note: Still in the works. Requires some cleaning up. Plans for future include increasing range of 'kilectable' items to text and webpages as well. Furthermore, if time allows it, the inclusion of directories for indexing. Furthermore, giving the 'tags' actual tag functionality.

Update: Version 1.0.0.4 is out! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kilxn/aajbjhafaaaabakjnhngiblipmmkpedf
